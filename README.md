🌟 How It Works
Authentication:
New users can register, while existing users can log in to manage their itineraries.

Creating Itineraries:
Fill out the form with details like location, date, and budget, then save it.

Sharing Itineraries:
Mark an itinerary as "shared" to make it visible to others. Shared itineraries are accessible in a read-only mode for other users.

Editing/Deleting Itineraries:
Users can edit or delete their own itineraries. Shared itineraries cannot be modified by others.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Add real-time collaboration for shared itineraries.
Integration with APIs for fetching destination-specific travel tips or recommendations.
Include itinerary analytics for better planning (e.g., budget tracking).
Mobile app development for seamless travel planning on the go.
